# Angular Elements

This is the working code for [Using Angular Elements — Why and How? — Part 1](https://blog.bitsrc.io/using-angular-elements-why-and-how-part-1-35f7fd4f0457) by Rajat S.

I say working code because there were many topo's in the article. Other wise it a very good article.

## Build

Run `./custombuild.sh` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `preview/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
